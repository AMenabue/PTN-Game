This project is a web-based game inspired by Wordle, where players guess a song from Pinguini Tattici Nucleari each day. 
Every word in the lyrics is initially censored except one, and each incorrect guess reveals a new word, giving players six attempts to solve the puzzle.


The game tracks statistics like number of plays, win rate, and streaks, creating a fun and competitive experience for fans.
The code was crafted with the help of ChatGPT, allowing me to bring this interactive music experience to life while focusing on design and gameplay.
